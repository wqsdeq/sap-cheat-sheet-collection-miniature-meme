# 🔐 Understanding of Single Sign-On (SSO) Concept

---

## 🧩 What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with **one set of login credentials** (username and password).

> Instead of logging into each system separately, the user logs in once and gains access to all connected systems without being prompted to log in again.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of SSO

- Improve **user experience** by reducing the number of login prompts.
- Enhance **security** through centralized authentication and control.
- Simplify **identity management** across systems.
- Reduce **password fatigue** and helpdesk support for forgotten passwords.

---

## 🛠 How SSO Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **User tries to access** an application (Service Provider).
2. The app redirects the user to a **central Identity Provider (IdP)** for authentication.
3. User logs in **once** at the IdP.
4. The IdP generates a **secure token** (e.g., SAML, JWT) confirming identity.
5. The application accepts this token and grants access.

## 🔄 Key SSO Technologies

| Protocol | Description                            | Common Use Cases             |
|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **SAML 2.0** | XML-based standard for enterprise SSO | SAP systems, enterprise apps |
| **OAuth 2.0** | Token-based access protocol           | REST APIs, BTP apps          |
| **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** | OAuth-based identity layer           | Cloud-native apps, mobile    |
| **Kerberos** | Network authentication for Windows AD | On-premise systems           |

## 🧱 SSO Components

| Component           | Description                                             |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **User**           | The individual trying to access a system                |
| **Service Provider (SP)** | Application the user wants to use                   |
| **Identity Provider (IdP)** | Authenticates the user and provides identity tokens |
| **SSO Token**      | The proof of authentication (e.g., SAML Assertion, JWT) |

## ✅ Benefits of SSO

- ✔️ One password to remember
- ✔️ Faster login experience
- ✔️ Centralized access control
- ✔️ Reduces attack surface
- ✔️ Improves productivity

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                               | Mitigation                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| If SSO credentials are compromised | Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)      |
| Single point of failure            | High availability setup for IdP            |
| Token theft                        | Use secure channels (HTTPS), token expiry  |
| Session hijacking                  | Implement session timeouts and re-auth     |

## 🔐 SSO in SAP Context

| Scenario                                | Technology Used             |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| SAP BTP access via corporate IdP       | SAML 2.0 or OIDC            |
| Fiori Launchpad SSO from Azure AD      | SAML 2.0                    |
| Integration Suite accessing SAP systems| OAuth 2.0 + Principal Propagation |
| SAP GUI with Windows login             | Kerberos                    |

---

## 🧪 Common Identity Providers

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- SAP Identity Authentication Service (IAS)
- Okta
- Ping Identity
- Auth0
- ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services)

---

## 🚀 Real-World Example

**Use Case**: An SAP employee accesses the SAP BTP Cockpit, SuccessFactors, and S/4HANA Fiori apps using one corporate login.

- User logs into the corporate **Identity Provider** (e.g., IAS).
- The login session is valid across all SAML-enabled apps.
- No need to enter credentials again until the session expires.

> 💡 SSO boosts security **when combined** with MFA, session control, and proper token management.
