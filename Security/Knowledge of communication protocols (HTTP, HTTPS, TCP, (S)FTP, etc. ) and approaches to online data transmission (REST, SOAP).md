# 📡 Knowledge of Communication Protocols and Data Transmission Approaches

---

## 🔌 Communication Protocols

---

### 1. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Foundation of data communication on the web.
- **Use Case**: REST APIs, Web Services, Web Portals.
- **Port**: 80
- ⚠️ **Not secure** (data sent in plain text).

---

### 2. **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**

- **Purpose**: Secure version of HTTP using TLS/SSL encryption.
- **Use Case**: REST/SOAP APIs, secure communication between systems.
- **Port**: 443
- ✅ Encrypts data in transit for confidentiality and integrity.

---

### 3. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Core protocol for reliable communication between systems.
- **Use Case**: Underlying protocol for HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, etc.
- **Features**:
  - Connection-oriented
  - Ensures packet delivery and correct order
- ❗ Not directly used for APIs, but essential for transport-level reliability.

---

### 4. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Transfer files between systems over a TCP/IP network.
- **Port**: 21 (control), 20 (data)
- ⚠️ Not secure (credentials and data sent as plain text).

---

### 5. **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Secure file transfer protocol using SSH.
- **Port**: 22
- ✅ Common for secure batch data transfers and integration flows.
- ✅ Widely used in B2B and SAP PI/PO scenarios.

---

### 6. **FTPS (FTP Secure)**

- **Purpose**: FTP over TLS/SSL.
- ✅ Adds encryption to FTP but more complex to configure.
- ⚠️ Not as commonly used as SFTP.

---

### 7. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Used for sending email messages.
- **Use Case**: Notifications, alerts, system messages.
- **Port**: 25 (or 587 for secure SMTP)
- ✉️ Useful in automated workflows that send emails.

---

### 8. **WebSocket**

- **Purpose**: Full-duplex communication between client and server over a single connection.
- **Use Case**: Real-time dashboards, IoT, chat, or stock feeds.
- **Port**: 80 (ws), 443 (wss)

---

## 🌐 Data Transmission Approaches

---

### 1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**

- **Type**: Web-based architectural style.
- **Protocol**: Uses HTTP/HTTPS.
- **Format**: JSON, XML, or plain text.
- **Operations**: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Advantages**:
  - Lightweight
  - Human-readable
  - Stateless
  - Easy to consume by web/mobile/cloud apps

#### ✅ Use Cases:
- SAP BTP → S/4HANA APIs (OData)
- SAP Integration Suite to external services
- Mobile app integrations

---

### 2. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**

- **Type**: Protocol for exchanging structured information via XML.
- **Protocol**: Usually over HTTP/S or SMTP.
- **Format**: XML
- **Features**:
  - Built-in error handling (faults)
  - Security via WS-Security
  - Support for strict contract-based WSDLs

#### ✅ Use Cases:
- SAP PI/PO integrations
- Legacy system communication
- Services requiring formal contracts or compliance (e.g., banking)

| Protocol/Approach | Type          | Secure Version | Format | Use Case Example                            |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| HTTP              | Protocol      | HTTPS           | Any    | REST APIs, Web Services                      |
| HTTPS             | Protocol      | ✅ Yes          | Any    | Secure REST/SOAP, UI apps, Integration flows|
| TCP               | Protocol      | ❌ (raw)        | Any    | Base transport layer for many protocols     |
| FTP               | Protocol      | ❌             | File   | Unsecured file transfers                    |
| SFTP              | Protocol      | ✅ Yes         | File   | Secure batch integrations, B2B transfers    |
| FTPS              | Protocol      | ✅ Yes         | File   | Alternative to SFTP                         |
| SMTP              | Protocol      | ✅ (via TLS)    | Email  | Notifications, alerts                       |
| REST              | Data Exchange | HTTPS           | JSON   | SAP API calls, lightweight integrations     |
| SOAP              | Data Exchange | HTTPS           | XML    | Enterprise, compliant, legacy integrations  |

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always prefer **HTTPS over HTTP**.
- Use **SFTP** for secure file-based data transfers.
- Choose **REST** for modern, lightweight, cloud-native APIs.
- Use **SOAP** when contract strictness or enterprise standards are required.
- Validate and sanitize all incoming/outgoing data.
- Implement **authentication (OAuth, Basic, etc.)** with every request.

> 🔐 The choice of protocol and transmission approach should align with **security, performance, system compatibility, and data sensitivity**.
