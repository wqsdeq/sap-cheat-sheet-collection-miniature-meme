# 🌐 SAP BTP Environments: Neo vs. Cloud Foundry

SAP BTP supports multiple runtime environments to host and manage applications. The two most commonly used are **Neo** and **Cloud Foundry (CF)**.

---

## 🔷 What is the Neo Environment?

### 📌 Description:
- Proprietary SAP-hosted environment.
- Available only in **SAP-owned data centers**.
- Supports Java, HTML5, and SAP-specific services.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Customers already using SAP Classic apps
- Projects relying on SAP Web IDE, SAP Workflow (Neo), or older services
- Scenarios where tight integration with SAP Business Suite is needed

### ⚙️ Functions:
- Deploy Java and HTML5 apps
- Integrate with SAP services like Portal and Workflow
- Built-in support for SAP Identity Provider (SAP ID)

### 🧭 How to Assign Neo to a Subaccount:
1. Neo is only available in **global accounts provisioned with Neo**.
2. During subaccount creation, select a **Neo-compatible region** (e.g., `Europe (Rot)`)
3. Choose **"Neo"** as the environment.
4. Only one environment (Neo) is allowed per Neo subaccount.

## 🔶 What is the Cloud Foundry Environment?

### 📌 Description:
- Open-source, multi-language cloud runtime.
- Available in both **SAP and hyperscaler (AWS, Azure, GCP)** regions.
- Supports Java, Node.js, Go, Python, and more.

### ✅ Use Cases:
- Modern app development using CAP or microservices
- Integration with non-SAP services (REST APIs, third-party DBs)
- DevOps, CI/CD, and container-based deployments

### ⚙️ Functions:
- Run multi-runtime apps
- Use service instances and bindings
- Integrate with Cloud Foundry buildpacks and SAP BTP services

### 🧭 How to Assign Cloud Foundry to a Subaccount:
1. Create a subaccount under a **Cloud Foundry-enabled global account**
2. Choose a **CF-supported region** (e.g., `Europe (Frankfurt)`)
3. After creation, click **"Enable Cloud Foundry"**
4. Create an **Org** and **Space** (e.g., `dev`)

## 📚 Recommendations

- ✅ **Choose Cloud Foundry** for:
  - Modern apps using CAP, Node.js, or containers
  - Hyperscaler flexibility
  - Better integration with CI/CD tools

- ⚠️ **Use Neo** only if:
  - You have legacy apps requiring Neo services
  - Your global account was provisioned with Neo only

---

## 🧩 Additional Notes

- You **cannot mix Neo and CF** in a single subaccount.
- SAP is investing more in **Cloud Foundry, Kyma, and ABAP** environments going forward.
- Always check regional availability before choosing an environment.
