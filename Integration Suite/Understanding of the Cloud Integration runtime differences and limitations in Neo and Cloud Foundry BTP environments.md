# ☁️ SAP Cloud Integration Runtime: Neo vs. Cloud Foundry

SAP Cloud Integration (part of Integration Suite) runs on two BTP environments: **Neo** and **Cloud Foundry (CF)**. While they offer similar core capabilities, there are important **differences and limitations** depending on the environment.

## 🧩 1. Environment Overview

| Feature             | Neo                                    | Cloud Foundry (CF)                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Hosting Region**  | Limited to SAP-hosted data centers      | Available in multi-cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) |
| **Runtime Stack**   | Java-based, proprietary SAP runtime     | Kubernetes/Docker-based modern runtime         |
| **Extensibility**   | Limited                                 | Highly extensible with sidecars, microservices |

## ⚙️ 2. Cloud Integration Capabilities

| Capability                          | Neo                           | Cloud Foundry (CF)               |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **iFlow Designer**                  | ✅ Same Web UI                 | ✅ Same Web UI                   |
| **Adapters Support**                | ✅ Limited set                 | ✅ Full adapter set              |
| **Message Queuing**                 | ❌ Not supported                | ✅ Supported via Event Mesh, JMS |
| **Scaling & Multi-Tenancy**        | ❌ Manual scaling              | ✅ Auto-scaling, containerized   |
| **Tenant Isolation**                | Single-tenant per subaccount   | Multi-tenant possible            |
| **CI/CD Support**                   | Manual export/import           | ✅ CI/CD via APIs, CLI           |
| **Booster Support**                 | ❌ No booster                  | ✅ Available via cockpit         |
| **Custom Domain Mapping**          | Limited                        | ✅ Fully supported               |

## 🧪 3. Use Cases & Recommendations

| Use Case                                     | Recommended Environment |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Small-scale integrations in SAP-only stack   | Neo                     |
| Scalable integrations with multi-cloud needs | Cloud Foundry           |
| Event-driven architectures                   | Cloud Foundry           |
| Integration with external partners (B2B)     | Cloud Foundry           |
| Long-term investment & modern architecture   | Cloud Foundry           |

## 🚫 4. Limitations in Neo

- ❗ **No horizontal scaling** – cannot scale automatically under load.
- ❗ **JMS/queue-based scenarios not supported**
- ❗ **No booster support** – must set up Cloud Integration manually.
- ❗ **CI/CD automation limited** – lacks APIs for iFlow deployment.
- ❗ **Only available in SAP-hosted data centers** – no hyperscaler regions.

## ✅ 5. Benefits of Cloud Foundry Runtime

- 🌍 **Multi-cloud support** (AWS, Azure, GCP, SAP)
- 📦 **Container-based architecture** – better performance, isolation
- 📈 **CI/CD friendly** – integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- 🔄 **Native support for Event Mesh and Kafka**
- 🧱 **Side-by-side extensibility** with CAP/Node/Java apps

## 🔄 6. Migration from Neo to Cloud Foundry

| Step                           | Action                                                           |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Export iFlows                  | Use Web UI export or OData APIs                                 |
| Set up Integration Suite in CF | Use Booster or manual setup                                     |
| Re-deploy iFlows               | Import via Web UI or deploy via API                             |
| Reconfigure Destinations       | Recreate or use Destination service in CF                       |
| Update Endpoint URLs           | CF URLs are different than Neo                                  |

> 🔔 **Note**: SAP recommends **migrating to Cloud Foundry** for new development.
